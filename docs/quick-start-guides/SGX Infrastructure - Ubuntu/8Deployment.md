# Deployment 

## Deployment Using Ansible

The below details would enable the deployment through Ansible Role for Intel® SecL-DC Secure Key Caching Usecase. However the services can still be installed manually using the Product Guide. More details on Ansible Role for Intel® SecL-DC in [Ansible-Role](https://github.com/intel-secl/utils/tree/v4.0/develop/tools/ansible-role) repository.

### Download the Ansible Role 

The role can be cloned locally from git and the contents can be copied to the roles folder used by your ansible server 

```shell
#Create directory for using ansible deployment
mkdir -p /root/intel-secl/deploy/

#Clone the repository
cd /root/intel-secl/deploy/ && git clone https://github.com/intel-secl/utils.git

#Checkout to specific release version
cd utils/
git checkout <release-version of choice>
cd tools/ansible-role

#Update ansible.cfg roles_path to point to path(/root/intel-secl/deploy/utils/tools/ansible-role/roles/)
```

### Update Ansible Inventory

The following inventory can be used and created under `/etc/ansible/hosts`

```
[CSP]
<machine1_ip/hostname>

[Enterprise]
<machine2_ip/hostname>

[Node]
<machine3_ip/hostname>

[CSP:vars]
isecl_role=csp
ansible_user=<ubuntu_user>
ansible_sudo_pass=<password>
ansible_password=<password>

[Enterprise:vars]
isecl_role=enterprise
ansible_user=<ubuntu_user>
ansible_sudo_pass=<password>
ansible_password=<password>

[Node:vars]
isecl_role=node
ansible_user=<ubuntu_user>
ansible_sudo_pass=<password>
ansible_password=<password>
```

???+ note 
    Ansible requires `ssh` and `root` user access to remote machines. The following command can be used to ensure ansible can connect to remote machines with host key check `
	```shell
	ssh-keyscan -H <ip_address> >> /root/.ssh/known_hosts
	```


### Create and Run Playbook

The following are playbook and CLI example for deploying Intel® SecL-DC binaries based on the supported deployment models and usecases. The below example playbooks can be created as `site-bin-isecl.yml`

???+ note 
    If running behind a proxy, update the proxy variables under `<path to ansible role>/ansible-role/vars/main.yml` and run as below

???+ note 
    Go through the `Additional Examples and Tips` section for specific workflow samples

**Option 1**

Update the PCS Server key with following vars in `<path to ansible role>/ansible-role/defaults/main.yml`

```yaml
  intel_provisioning_server_api_key_sandbox: <pcs server key>
```

Create playbook with following contents

```yaml
- hosts: all
  remote_user: root
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  gather_facts: yes
  any_errors_fatal: true
  vars:
    setup: <setup var from supported usecases>
    binaries_path: <path where built binaries are copied to>
    backend_pykmip: "<yes/no to install pykmip server along with KMIP KBS>"
  roles:   
  - ansible-role
  environment:
    http_proxy: "{{http_proxy}}"
    https_proxy: "{{https_proxy}}"
    no_proxy: "{{no_proxy}}"
```

and

```shell
ansible-playbook <playbook-name>
```

OR

**Option 2:**

Create playbook with following contents

```yaml
- hosts: all
  remote_user: root
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  gather_facts: yes
  any_errors_fatal: true
  roles:   
  - ansible-role
  environment:
    http_proxy: "{{http_proxy}}"
    https_proxy: "{{https_proxy}}"
    no_proxy: "{{no_proxy}}"
```

and

```shell
ansible-playbook <playbook-name> --extra-vars setup=<setup var from supported usecases> --extra-vars binaries_path=<path where built binaries are copied to> --extra-vars intel_provisioning_server_api_key=<pcs server key> --extra-vars backend_pykmip=yes
```

???+ note 
    If any service installation fails due to any misconfiguration, just uninstall the specific service manually , fix the misconfiguration in ansible and rerun the playbook. The successfully installed services won't be reinstalled.


### Usecase Setup Options

| Usecase                      | Variable                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Secure Key Caching           | `setup: secure-key-caching` in playbook or via `--extra-vars` as `setup=secure-key-caching`in CLI |

???+ note 
    Orchestrator installation is not bundled with the role and need to be done independently. Also, components dependent on the orchestrator like `isecl-k8s-extensions` and `integration-hub` are installed either partially or not installed

## Deployment Using Binaries

### Setup K8S Cluster and Deploy Isecl-k8s-extensions

* Setup master and worker node for k8s. Worker node should be setup on SGX enabled host machine. Master node can be any system.

* To setup k8 cluster follow https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-kubernetes-on-ubuntu Once the master/worker setup is done, follow below steps on Master Node:

### Untar packages and push OCI images to registry

* Copy tar output isecl-k8s-extensions-*.tar.gz from build system's binaries folder to /opt/ directory on the Master Node and extract the contents.
  
  ```shell
    cd /opt/
    tar -xvzf isecl-k8s-extensions-*.tar.gz
    cd isecl-k8s-extensions/
  ```
  
* Configure private registry

* Push images to private registry using skopeo command, (this can be done from build vm also)
  
  ```shell
     skopeo copy oci-archive:isecl-k8s-controller-v4.0.0-<commitid>.tar docker://<registryIP>:<registryPort>/isecl-k8s-controller:v4.0.0
     skopeo copy oci-archive:isecl-k8s-scheduler-v4.0.0-<commitid>.tar docker://<registryIP>:<registryPort>/isecl-k8s-scheduler:v4.0.0
  ```
  
* Add the image names in isecl-controller.yml and isecl-scheduler.yml in /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/yamls with full image name including registry IP/hostname (e.g <registryIP>:<registryPort>/isecl-k8s-scheduler:v4.0.0). It will automatically pull the images from registry.
  

##### Deploy isecl-controller
* Create hostattributes.crd.isecl.intel.com crd
```
    kubectl apply -f yamls/crd-1.17.yaml
```
* Check whether the crd is created
```
    kubectl get crds
```
* Deploy isecl-controller
```
    kubectl apply -f yamls/isecl-controller.yaml
```
* Check whether the isecl-controller is up and running
```
    kubectl get deploy -n isecl
```
* Create clusterrolebinding for ihub to get access to cluster nodes
```
    kubectl create clusterrolebinding isecl-clusterrole --clusterrole=system:node --user=system:serviceaccount:isecl:isecl
```
* Fetch token required for ihub installation and follow below IHUB installation steps,
```
    kubectl get secrets -n isecl
    kubectl describe secret default-token-<name> -n isecl
```

For IHUB installation, make sure to update below configuration in /root/binaries/env/ihub.env before installing ihub on CSP system:
* Copy /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt from master node to /root on CSP system. Update KUBERNETES_CERT_FILE.
* Get k8s token in master, using above commands and update KUBERNETES_TOKEN
* Update the value of CRD name
```
	KUBERNETES_CRD=custom-isecl-sgx
```

##### Deploy isecl-scheduler
* The isecl-scheduler default configuration is provided for common cluster support in /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/yamls/isecl-scheduler.yaml. Variables HVS_IHUB_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH and SGX_IHUB_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH are by default set to default paths. Please use and set only required variables based on the use case. 
For example, if only sgx based attestation is required then remove/comment HVS_IHUB_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH variables.

* Install cfssl and cfssljson on Kubernetes Control Plane
```
    #Download cfssl to /usr/local/bin/
    wget -O /usr/local/bin/cfssl http://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssl_linux-amd64
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cfssl

    #Download cfssljson to /usr/local/bin
    wget -O /usr/local/bin/cfssljson http://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssljson_linux-amd64
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cfssljson
```

* Create tls key pair for isecl-scheduler service, which is signed by k8s apiserver.crt
```
    cd /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/
    chmod +x create_k8s_extsched_cert.sh
    ./create_k8s_extsched_cert.sh -n "K8S Extended Scheduler" -s "<K8_MASTER_IP>","<K8_MASTER_HOST>" -c /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt -k /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key
```
* After iHub deployment, copy /etc/ihub/ihub_public_key.pem from ihub to /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/ directory on k8 master system. Also, copy tls key pair generated in previous step to secrets directory.
```
    mkdir secrets
    cp /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/server.key secrets/
    cp /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/server.crt secrets/
    mv /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/ihub_public_key.pem /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/sgx_ihub_public_key.pem
    cp /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/sgx_ihub_public_key.pem secrets/
```
???+ note 
    Prefix the attestation type for ihub_public_key.pem before copying to secrets folder.
* Create kubernetes secrets scheduler-secret for isecl-scheduler
```
    kubectl create secret generic scheduler-certs --namespace isecl --from-file=secrets
```
* Deploy isecl-scheduler
```
    kubectl apply -f yamls/isecl-scheduler.yaml
```
* Check whether the isecl-scheduler is up and running
```
    kubectl get deploy -n isecl
```

##### Configure kube-scheduler to establish communication with isecl-scheduler
* Add scheduler-policy.json under kube-scheduler section, mountPath under container section and hostPath under volumes section in /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml as mentioned below
```
spec:
  containers:
  - command:
    - kube-scheduler
    - --policy-config-file=/opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/scheduler-policy.json
```

```
  containers:
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/
      name: extendedsched
      readOnly: true
```

```
  volumes:
  - hostPath:
      path: /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/
      type:
    name: extendedsched
```

???+ note 
    Make sure to use proper indentation and don't delete existing mountPath and hostPath sections in kube-scheduler.yaml.
* Restart Kubelet which restart all the k8s services including kube base schedular
```
	systemctl restart kubelet
```

* Check if CRD data is populated
```
	kubectl get -o json hostattributes.crd.isecl.intel.com
```
