# System User Configuration 

**Build System**

**Setup ~/.gitconfig to update the git user details. A sample config is provided below**

GIT Configuration**

```
[user]
        name = John Doe
        email = john.doe@abc.com
[color]
        ui = auto
 [push]
        default = matching 
```

* Make sure system date and time of SGX machine and CSP machine both are in sync. Also, if the system is configured to read the RTC time in the local time zone, then use RTC in UTC by running `timedatectl set-local-rtc 0` command on both the machine. Otherwise SGX Agent deployment will fail with certificate expiry error.
