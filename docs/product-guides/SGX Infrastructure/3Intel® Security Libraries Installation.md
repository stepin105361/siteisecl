## Hardware Considerations

### Supported **Hardware**

-   Intel® Xeon® SP products those support SGX

### BIOS Requirements

-   Intel® SGX-TEM BIOS requirements are outlined in the latest Intel® SGX Platforms BIOS Writer's Guide

-   Intel® SGX should be enabled in BIOS menu (Intel® SGX is Disabled by default on Ice Lake).

-   Intel® SGX BIOS requirements include exposing Flexible Launch Control menu.


### OS Requirements (Intel® SGX does not supported on 32-bit OS):

-   Linux: RHEL 8.2

-   Linux: Ubuntu 18.04

### Requirements for Containerized Deployment with K8s

#### Operating System:

* RHEL 8.2
* Ubuntu 18.04

#### Kubernetes

* Single-node: `microk8s` (1.17.17)
* Multi-node: `kubeadm` (1.17.17)

#### Container Runtime

* Docker 19.03.13 on RHEL 8.2
* Docker 19.03.5 on Ubuntu 18.04

#### Storage:

* `hostPath` for Single Node `microk8s` for all services and agents
* `NFS` for Multi Node `kubeadm` for all services, `hostPath ` for sgx_agent and skc_library

##  Recommended Service Layout

The Intel® SecL-DC services can be installed in a variety of layouts, partially depending on the use cases desired and the OS of the server(s) to be protected. In general, the Intel® SecL-DC applications can be divided into management services that are deployed on the network on the management plane, and host or node components that must be installed on each protected server.

Management services can typically be deployed anywhere with network access to all the protected servers. This could be a set of individual VMs per service; containers; or all installed on a single physical or virtual machine.

Node components must be installed on each protected physical server.

Typically, this is needed for Linux deployments.

For a POC environment, all the management services can be installed on a single machine or VM.

This Includes:

-   Certificate Management Service (CMS)

-   Authentication and Authorization Service (AAS)

-   SGX Caching Service (SCS)

-   SGX Host Verification Service (SHVS)

-   Integration HUB (IHUB)

-   Key Broker Service (KBS) with backend key management

-   SGX Quote Verification Service (SQVS)

SGX Agent & SKC Library needs to be installed on SGX Enabled Machine.

Isecl-K8s-extensions must be installed on separate VM.

## Recommended Service Layout & Architecture - Containerized Deployment with K8s

The containerized deployment makes use of Kubernetes orchestrator for single node and multi node deployments. The supported deployment models are as below:

**Single Node:**

![k8s-single-node](./Images/k8s-single-node.png)



**Multi Node:**

![K8s Deployment-sqx](./Images/k8s-deployment-sgx.jpg)



**Services Deployments & Agent DaemonSets:**

Every service including databases will be deployed as separate K8s deployment with 1 replica, i.e(1 pod per deployment). Each deployment will be further exposed through k8s service and also will be having corresponding Persistent Volume Claims(PV) for configuration and log directories and mounted on persistent storage. In case of daemonsets/agents, the configuration and log directories will be mounted on respective Baremetal worker nodes.

![Each pod consist of only one container with service](./Images/pod-deployment.jpg)

For stateful services which requires database like shvs, aas, scs, A separate database deployment will be created for each of such services. The data present on the database deployment will also made to persist on a NFS, through K8s persistent storage mechanism

![database deployment](./Images/shvs-db.jpg)



**Networking within the Cluster:**

![Networking within cluster](./Images/within-cluster-communication-sgx.jpg)



**Networking Outside the Cluster:**

![Networking outside cluster](./Images/inter-cluster-communication-sgx.jpg)

**SKC Virtualization:**

![](.\Images\sgx-virtualization-model.jpg)

Follow the [Installation of Containerized Services and Agent in K8s Cluster](#Installation of Containerized Services and Agent in K8s Cluster) for installation instructions once deployment model is chosen.

### Using the provided Database Installation Script 

Install a sample Postgresql 11 database using the install_pgdb.sh script provided in binaries directory. This script will automatically install the Postgresql database and client packages required.

Create the iseclpgdb.env answer file:

```shell
ISECL_PGDB_IP_INTERFACES=localhost

ISECL_PGDB_PORT=5432

ISECL_PGDB_SAVE_DB_INSTALL_LOG=true

ISECL_PGDB_CERT_DNS=localhost

ISECL_PGDB_CERT_IP=127.0.0.1
```

Note that the values above assume that the database will be accessed locally. If the database server will be external to the Intel® SecL services, change these values to the hostname or FQDN and IP address where the client will access the database server.

### Provisioning the Database

Each Intel® SecL service that uses a database (the Authentication and Authorization Service, the SGX host Verification Service, the SGX caching Service,) requires its own schema and access. The database must be created and initialized. Execute the install_pgdb.sh script to install the database.

If a single shared database server will be used for each Intel® SecL service (for example, if all management plane services will be installed on a single VM), run install_pgdb.sh script only once and create_db.sh script for each component that uses a database.

If separate database servers will be used (for example, if the management plane services will reside on separate systems and will use their own local database servers), execute the install_pgdb.sh script on each server hosting a database and create_db.sh script for each component that uses a DB. 

Command to install postgres DB:
```
./install_pgdb.sh
```
Command to create DB for AAS/SCS/SHVS:
```
./create_db.sh <DB Name> <DB Username> <DB Password>
```

Note that the db name, db username and db user password should match with the respective component environment files.

###  Database Server TLS Certificate

The database client for Intel® SecL services requires the database TLS certificate to authenticate communication with the database server.

If the database server for a service is located on the same server that the service will run on, only the path to this certificate is needed. If the provided Postgres scripts are used, the certificate will be in /usr/local/pgsql/data/server.crt.

If the database server will be run separately from the Intel® SecL service(s), the certificate will need to be copied from the database server to the service machine before installing the Intel® SecL services.

The database client for Intel® SecL services will validate that the Subject Alternative Names in the database server's TLS certificate contain the hostname(s)/IP address(es) that the clients will use to access the database server. If configuring a database without using the provided scripts, ensure that these attributes are present in the database TLS certificate.

## Installation of Containerized Services and Agent in K8s Cluster

The containerized deployment utilizes K8s orchestrator to deploy SGX components. The deployments are fairly automated once the pre-reqs are in place for K8s cluster deployments. 

???+ note 
    The K8s manifests are declarative in nature and the same can be modified as required for SGX services deployments for single node and multi node deployments. Modifications would require specific steps to ensure services and agents get updated as per the required configuration. More details for the same present in Setup Task Flows for K8s Deployments, Configuration Update Flows for K8s Deployments and [Intel Security Libraries Configuration Settings ](#intel-security-libraries-configuration-settings).

### Pre-requisites

* Ensure based on the deployment model , `microk8s` or `kubeadm` in installed. Supported versions in [Requirements for Containerized Deployment with K8s](#requirements-for-containerized-deployment-with-k8s).
* Docker runtime is configured for each of these deployments. Supported versions in [Requirements for Containerized Deployment with K8s](#requirements-for-containerized-deployment-with-k8s).
* The build would generate a script for platform dependencies under `<working directory>/k8s/platform dependencies`.
* Follow the deployment pre-reqs as given in the [Quick Start guide](https://github.com/intel-secl/docs/blob/v4.0/develop/quick-start-guides/SGX%20Infrastructure%20-%20Containerization.md#deployment) based on the chosen deployment model.

### Deploy Steps

* The deploy steps are detailed in the [Quick Start guide](https://github.com/intel-secl/docs/blob/v4.0/develop/quick-start-guides/SGX%20Infrastructure%20-%20Containerization.md#deploy-steps) based on the deployment model. Follow the instructions for the deployment using the scripts.

## Installing the Certificate Management Service

### Required For

The CMS is REQUIRED for all use cases.

### Supported Operating System 

The Intel® Security Libraries Certificate Management Service supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 and Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS(Bionic Beaver).

### Recommended Hardware

-   1 vCPUs

-   RAM: 2 GB

-   10 GB

-   One network interface with network access to all Intel® SecL-DC services

### Installation

To install the Intel® SecL-DC Certificate Management Service:

* Copy the Certificate Management Service installation binary to the /root/ directory.

* Create the `cms.env` installation answer file for an unattended installation:

```shell
AAS_TLS_SAN=\< Comma-Separated list of IPs and hostnames for the AAS\>

AAS_API_URL=https://\< Authentication and Authorization Service IP or Hostname\>:8444/aas/v1

SAN_LIST=< Comma-Separated list of IP addresses and hostnames for the CMS>
```

The SAN list will be used to authenticate the Certificate Signing Request from the AAS to the CMS. Only a CSR originating from a host matching the SAN list will be honored. Later, in the AAS `authservice.env` installation answer file, this same SAN list will be provided for the AAS installation. These lists must match and must be valid for IPs and/or hostnames used by the AAS system. The SAN list variables also accept the wildcards "?" (for single-character wildcards) and "\*" (for multiple-character wildcards) to allow address ranges or multiple FQDNs.

The `AAS_API_URL` represents the URL for the AAS that will exist after the AAS is installed.

For all configuration options and their descriptions, refer to the Intel® SecL Configuration section on the Certificate Management Service.

* Execute the installer binary.

```
./cms-v4.0.0.bin
```
When the installation completes, the Certificate Management Service is available. The services can be verified by running cms status from the command line.
```
cms status
```

After installation is complete, the CMS will output a bearer token to the console. This token will be used with the AAS during installation to authenticate certificate requests to the CMS. If this token expires or otherwise needs to be recreated, use the following command:

```
cms setup cms-auth-token \--force
```

In addition, the SHA384 digest of the CMS TLS certificate will be needed for installation of the remaining Intel® SecL services. The digest can be obtained using the following command:

```
cms tlscertsha384
```

## Installing the Authentication and Authorization Service 

### Required For

The AAS is REQUIRED for all use cases.

### Prerequisites

The following must be completed before installing the Authentication and Authorization Service:

-   The Certificate Management Service must be installed and available

-   The Authentication and Authorization Service database must be available

### Package Dependencies

The Intel® SecL-DC Authentication and Authorization Service (AAS) requires a Postgresql 11 database. script (install_pgdb.sh) is provided with the AAS that will install Postgresql repositories.

### Supported Operating Systems

The Intel® Security Libraries Authentication and Authorization Service supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 and Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS(Bionic Beaver).

### Recommended Hardware 

-   1 vCPUs

-   RAM: 2 GB

-   10 GB

-   One network interface with network access to all Intel® SecL-DC services

### Installation


Before AAS is installed, Database needs to be created. Use the following commands to install postgres and create AAS DB

copy install_pgdb.sh and create_db.sh to /root/ directory
```
./install_pgdb.sh

./create_db.sh <db name> <db_user> <db_password>
```

To install the AAS, a bearer token from the CMS is required. This bearer token is output at the end of the CMS installation. However, if a new token is needed, simply use the following command from the CMS command line:

```
cms setup cms-auth-token --force
```

Create the authservice.env installation answer file in /root/ directory as below:

      CMS_BASE_URL=https://< CMS IP or hostname>:8445/cms/v1/
    
      CMS_TLS_CERT_SHA384=<CMS TLS certificate sha384>
      
      AAS_DB_SSLMODE=verify-full
    
      AAS_DB_HOSTNAME=<IP or hostname of database server>
    
      AAS_DB_PORT=<database port number; default is 5432>
    
      AAS_DB_NAME=<database name>
    
      AAS_DB_USERNAME=<database username>
    
      AAS_DB_PASSWORD=<database password>
    
      AAS_DB_SSLCERTSRC=<path to database TLS certificate; the default location is typically /usr/local/pgsql/data/server.crt>
    
      AAS_ADMIN_USERNAME=<username for AAS administrative user>
    
      AAS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<password for AAS administrative user>
    
      AAS_JWT_TOKEN_DURATION_MINS=2880
    
      SAN_LIST=<comma-separated list of IPs and hostnames for the AAS; this should match the value for the AAS_TLS_SAN in the cms.env file from the CMS installation>
    
      BEARER_TOKEN=<bearer token from CMS installation>

Execute the AAS installer:

```
./authservice-v4.0.0.bin
```

???+ note 
    The AAS_ADMIN credentials specified in this answer file will have administrator rights for the AAS and can be used to create other users, create new roles, and assign roles to users.

### Creating Users

Before deployment is initiated, user account and roles must be generated for each component.  Most of these accounts will be service users, used by the various Intel® SecL SKC services to work together.

Creating these required users and roles is facilitated by the populate-user script.

### Creating Users and Roles 

During installation of each services, number of user accounts and roles specific to services must be generated. Most of these accounts will be service users, which is used by the various services to function together. Another set of users will be used for installation permissions, and administrative user will be created to provide the initial authentication interface for the actual user based on the organizational requirements. Creating these required users and roles is facilitated by a script that will accept credentials and configuration settings from an answer file and automate the process.
Create the `populate-users.env` file using the following values:

```shell
# SKC Components include AAS,SCS,SHVS,SQVS,SIH and SKBS.
ISECL_INSTALL_COMPONENTS=AAS,SCS,SHVS,SQVS,SIH,SKBS

AAS_API_URL=https://<AAS IP address or hostname>:8444/aas/v1
AAS_ADMIN_USERNAME=<AAS username>
AAS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<AAS password>

IH_CERT_SAN_LIST=<comma-separated list of IPs and hostnames for the Integration Hub>
KBS_CERT_SAN_LIST=<comma-separated list of IPs and hostnames for the Key Broker Service>
SCS_CERT_SAN_LIST=<comma-separated list of IPs and hostnames for the SGX Caching Service>
SQVS_CERT_SAN_LIST=<comma-separated list of IPs and hostnames for the SGX Quote Verification Service>
SHVS_CERT_SAN_LIST=<comma-separated list of IPs and hostnames for the SGX Host Verification Service>

IHUB_SERVICE_USERNAME=<Username for the Hub service user>
IHUB_SERVICE_PASSWORD=<Password for the Hub service user>

SCS_SERVICE_USERNAME=<Username for the SCS service user>
SCS_SERVICE_PASSWORD=<Password for the SCS service user>

SHVS_SERVICE_USERNAME=<Username for the SHVS service user>
SHVS_SERVICE_PASSWORD=<Password for the SHVS service user>

KBS_SERVICE_USERNAME=<Username for the KBS service user>
KBS_SERVICE_PASSWORD=<Password for the KBS service user>

INSTALL_ADMIN_USERNAME=<Username for the Admin user>
INSTALL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<Password for the Admin user>

CCC_ADMIN_USERNAME=<Username for the Custom Claims Creator Admin user>
CCC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<Password for the Custom Claims Creator Admin user>

```
???+ note 
    The `ISECL_INSTALL_COMPONENTS` variable is a comma-separated list of all the components that will be used in your environment. Not all services are required for every use case. Include only services which are required specific to the use case.

???+ note 
    The SAN list variables each support wildcards( "*" and "?"). Using wildcards, domain names and entire IP ranges can be included in the SAN list, which will allow any host matching those ranges to install the relevant service. The SAN list specified here must exactly match the SAN list for the applicable service in that service’s env installation file.

Execute the populate-users script:
```shell
./populate-users
```

The script will automatically generate the following users:

-   Authentication and Authorization Service (AAS)
-   SGX Caching Service (SCS)
-   SGX Host Verificatin Service (SHVS)
-   Integration HUB (IHUB)
-   Key Broker Service (KBS) with backend key management
-   Installation Admin User
-   CCC Admin User

These user accounts will be used during installation of each components of SGX Attestation or SKC. In general, whenever credentials are required by an installation answer file, the variable name should match the name of the corresponding variable used in the `populate-users.env` file.

The populate-users script will also output an installation token. This token has all privileges needed for installation of the services, and uses the credentials provided with the `INSTALL_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `INSTALL_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. The remaining Intel ® SecL-DC services require this token (set as the `BEARER_TOKEN` variable in the installation env files) to grant the appropriate privileges for installation. By default this token will be valid for two hours; the populate-users script can be rerun with the same `populate-users.env` file to regenerate the token if more time is required, or the `INSTALL_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `INSTALL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` can be used to generate an authentication token.

The SGX Agent pushes SGX platform data to SGX Caching Service (SCS). SGX Agent gets current TCB Status for the platform from SCS. If SGX Host Verification Service (SHVS) URL is configured, the SGX Agent pushes platform enablement information and TCB Status to SHVS.

### Prerequisites 

-   The following must be completed before installing the SGX Agent:

    -   Certificate Management Service, Authentication and Authorization Service,SGX Caching Service and SGX Host Verification Service must be installed and available.
    -   Make sure system date and time of SGX machine and CSP machine both are in sync. Also, if the system is configured to read the RTC time in the local time zone, then use RTC in UTC by running`timedatectl set-local-rtc 0` command on both the machine. Otherwise SGX Agent deployment will fail with certificate expiry error. 

### Package Dependencies

The Intel® Security Libraries SGX Agent Service requires the following packages and their dependencies:

-   Golang packages

### Supported Operating Systems

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2
* Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS(Bionic Beaver).

**Recommended Hardware**

* To setup k8 cluster on RHEL 8.2, follow https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-kubernetes-on-centos 

* To setup k8 cluster on Ubuntu 18.04, follow the "Install, Enable and start the Docker daemon" section in Ubuntu Quick Start Guide - https://github.com/intel-secl/docs/blob/v4.0/develop/quick-start-guides/SGX%20Infrastructure%20-%20Ubuntu.md
Once done, go to https://vitux.com/install-and-deploy-kubernetes-on-ubuntu/ and follow from step 3 onwards.

* Once the master/worker setup is done, follow below steps on Master Node:

### Untar packages and push OCI images to registry

* Copy tar output isecl-k8s-extensions-*.tar.gz from build system's binaries folder to /opt/ directory on the Master Node and extract the contents.
  
  ```shell
    cd /opt/
    tar -xvzf isecl-k8s-extensions-*.tar.gz
    cd isecl-k8s-extensions/
  ```
  
* Configure private registry

* Push images to private registry using skopeo command, (this can be done from build vm also)
  
  ```shell
     skopeo copy oci-archive:isecl-k8s-controller-v4.0.0-<commitid>.tar docker://<registryIP>:<registryPort>/isecl-k8s-controller:v4.0.0
     skopeo copy oci-archive:isecl-k8s-scheduler-v4.0.0-<commitid>.tar docker://<registryIP>:<registryPort>/isecl-k8s-scheduler:v4.0.0
  ```
  
* Add the image names in isecl-controller.yml and isecl-scheduler.yml in /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/yamls with full image name including registry IP/hostname (e.g <registryIP>:<registryPort>/isecl-k8s-scheduler:v4.0.0). It will automatically pull the images from registry.
  

##### Deploy isecl-controller

* Create hostattributes.crd.isecl.intel.com crd

* Copy /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt from master node to /root on CSP VM. Update KUBERNETES_CERT_FILE.
* Get k8s token in master, using above commands and update KUBERNETES_TOKEN
* Update the value of CRD name

```
	KUBERNETES_CRD=custom-isecl-sgx
```

##### Deploy isecl-scheduler

The isecl-scheduler default configuration is provided for common cluster support in /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/yamls/isecl-scheduler.yaml.

Variables HVS_IHUB_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH and SGX_IHUB_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH are by default set to default paths. 

Please use and set only required variables based on the use case.

For example, if only sgx based attestation is required then remove/comment HVS_IHUB_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH variables.

* Install cfssl and cfssljson on Kubernetes Control Plane
```
    #Download cfssl to /usr/local/bin/
    wget -O /usr/local/bin/cfssl http://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssl_linux-amd64

##  Installing the Integration Hub

**Note:** The Integration Hub is only required to integrate Intel® SecL with third-party scheduler services, such as Kubernetes. The Integration Hub is not required for usage models that do not require Intel® SecL security attributes to be pushed to an integration endpoint.

### Required For

The Integration Hub is REQUIRED the for enabling support for orchestration support.

### Prerequisites

The Intel® Security Libraries Integration Hub can be run on a VM or on a bare-metal server. The Integration Hub may be installed on the same server (physical or VM) as the SGX Host Verification Service.

-   SGX Caching Service must be installed and available.

-   The SGX Host Verification Service must be installed and available

-   The Authentication and Authorization Service must be installed and available

-   The Certificate Management Service must be installed and available


### Package Dependencies

The Intel® SecL Integration Hub requires a number of packages and their dependencies:

-   Golang packages

If these are not already installed, the Integration Hub installer attempts to install these packages automatically using the package manager. Automatic installation requires access to package repositories (the RHEL/Ubuntu subscription repositories, the EPEL repository, or a suitable mirror), which may require an Internet connection. If the packages are to be installed from the package repository, be sure to update your repository package lists before installation.

### Supported Operating Systems

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2
* Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS(Bionic Beaver).

### Recommended Hardware

-   1 vCPUs

-   RAM: 2 GB

-   1 GB free space to install the Integration Hub (database and log space requirements are dependent on the number of managed servers).

-   One network interface with network access to the SGX Host Verification Service.

-   One network interface with network access to any integration endpoints (for example, OpenStack Nova).

#### Installing the Integration Hub

To install the SGX Integration Hub, follow these steps:

1. Copy the Integration Hub installation binary to the /root/ directory.

2. Create the ihub.env installation answer file in /root/ directory as below
```
    IHUB_SERVICE_USERNAME=< IHUB service user username > 
    IHUB_SERVICE_PASSWORD=< IHUB service user password > 
    SHVS_BASE_URL=< https://< SHVS IP or Hostname >:13000/sgx-hvs/v2
    CMS_TLS_CERT_SHA384=< CMS TLS digest > 
    BEARER_TOKEN=<Installation token> 
 
    AAS_API_URL=https://< AAS IP or Hostname >:8444/aas/v1
    CMS_BASE_URL=https://< CMS IP or Hostname >:8445/cms/v1
    POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES=2
    TLS_SAN_LIST=< comma separated list of IPs and hostnames for the IHUB >
    TENANT=< tenant-type e.g. KUBERNETES or OPENSTACK >

    # Kubernetes Integration Credentials - required for Kubernetes integration only
    KUBERNETES_URL=< https://< Kubernetes IP >:6443/>
    KUBERNETES_CRD=custom-isecl-sgx
    KUBERNETES_TOKEN=< K8S token >
    KUBERNETES_CERT_FILE =< Path of Kubernetes master node certificate >

    # OpenStack Integration Credentials - required for OpenStack integration only
    OPENSTACK_AUTH_URL=<OpenStack Keystone URL; typically http://openstack-ip:5000/>
    OPENSTACK_PLACEMENT_URL=<OpenStack Nova Placement API URL; typically http://openstack-ip:8778/>
    OPENSTACK_USERNAME=< OpenStack username >
    OPENSTACK_PASSWORD=< OpenStack password >
```
3.  Create Integrated Hub Service user account and Roles. A sample script is provided in the appendix section for reference. Update the BEARER_TOKEN with the TOKEN obtained after running populate-users.sh script

4.  Execute the installer binary.

```
./ihub-v4.0.0.bin
```

In case installation fails, its recommended to run the following command to clear failed service instance

```
systemctl reset-failed 
```

Copy IHUB public key to the master node and restart kubelet.

```
    scp -r /etc/ihub/ihub_public_key.pem <master-node IP>:/opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/
    systemctl restart kubelet
```

Run this command to validate if the data has been pushed to CRD: 

```
    kubectl get -o json hostattributes.crd.isecl.intel.com
```

Run this command to validate that the labels have been populated:

```
    kubectl get nodes --show-labels.
```

Sample labels:

```
    EPC-Memory=2.0GB,FLC-Enabled=true,SGX-Enabled=true,SGX-Supported=true,SgxTrustExpiry=2020-11-09T08.07.43Z,TCBUpToDate=true
```

Create sample yml file for nginx workload and add SGX labels to it such as:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    name: nginx
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
     requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
       nodeSelectorTerms:
       - matchExpressions:
         - key: SGX-Enabled
           operator: In
           values:
           - "true"
         - key: EPC-Memory
           operator: In
           values:
           - "2.0GB"
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

Validate if pod can be launched on the node. Run following commands:

```
    kubectl apply -f pod.yml
    kubectl get pods
    kubectl describe pods nginx 
```

Pod should be in running state and launched on the host as per values in pod.yml. Validate running below commands on sgx host:

```
	docker ps
```

## Integration with OpenStack (Supported only on RHEL 8.2, not supported on Ubuntu 18.04)

OpenStack can now use “Traits” to provide qualitative data about Nova Compute hosts to establish Trait requirements. The Integration Hub continually push SGX data to the OpenStack Traits resources. This means OpenStack scheduler natively supports workload scheduling incorporating SGX Host information, including SGX enabled/disabled, SGX supported/not supported, FLC enabled/not enabled, EPC memory size, TCB status upto date/not. The OpenStack Placement Service will automatically attempt to place images with Trait requirements on compute nodes that have those Traits.

???+ note 
    This control only applies to instances launched using the OpenStack scheduler, and the Traits functions will not affect manually-launched instances where a specific Compute Node is defined (since this does not use the scheduler at all). Intel SecL-DC uses existing OpenStack interfaces and does not modify OpenStack code.  The datacenter owner or OpenStack administrator is responsible for the security of the OpenStack workload scheduling process in general, and Intel recommends following published OpenStack security best practices.

Setting Image Traits
Image Traits define the policy for which Traits are required for that instance to be launched on a Nova Compute node.By setting these Traits to “required” the OpenStack scheduler will require the same Traits to be present on a Nova Compute node in order to launch instances. To set the Image Traits for Intel SecL-DC,a specific naming convention is used. This naming convention will match the Traits that the Integration Hub will automatically push to OpenStack. Two types of Traits are currently supported – one Trait is used to require that the Compute Node must be SGX supported and the other Trait is used to require specific SGXkey/value pairs.
Required Image trait for SGX Enabled Host:
```
CUSTOM_ISECL_SGX_ENABLED_TRUE=required
```
These Traits can be set using CLI commands for OpenStack Glance:
```
openstack image set --property trait:CUSTOM_ISECL_SGX_ENABLED_TRUE=required <image name>
```
To veiw the Traits that has been set:
```
openstack image show
```
List the set of resources mapped to the Openstack
```
openstack resource provider list
```
To view the traits enabled for the SGX Host:
```
openstack resource provider trait list <uuid of the host which the openstack resoruce provider lists>
```
Create the instances
```
openstack server create --flavor tiny --image <image name> --net vmnet <vm instance name>
```
Instances should be created and the status should be "Active". Instance should be launched successfully.
```
openstack server list
```
To remove a Trait that is not required for an Image:
```
openstack image unset --property trait:CUSTOM_ISECL_SGX_ENABLED_TRUE 
openstack image unset --property trait:CUSTOM_ISECL_SGX_ENABLED_FALSE 
```
Scheduling Instances
Once Trait requirements are set for Images and the Integration Hub is configured to push attributes to OpenStack, instances can be launched in OpenStack as normal. As long as the OpenStack Nova scheduler is used to schedule the workloads, only compliant Compute Nodes will be scheduled to run instances of controlled Images.

???+ note 
    This control only applies to instances launched using the OpenStack scheduler and the Traits functions will not affect manually-launched instances where a specific Compute Node is defined (since this does not use the scheduler at all). Intel SecL-DC uses existing OpenStack interfaces and does not modify OpenStack code. The datacenter owner or OpenStack administrator is responsible for the security of the
OpenStack workload scheduling process in general and Intel recommends following published OpenStack security best practices.


##  Installing the Key Broker Service

### Required for

The KBS is REQUIRED for

\- Storing Application Keys and Verifying the SGX Quote

### Prerequisites

The following must be completed before installing the Key Broker:

-   The Authentication and Authorization Service must be installed and available

-   The Certificate Management Service must be installed and available

If a 3rd-party Key Management server will be used following must be completed before installing the Key Broker:

-   A KMIP 3rd-party Key management Server must be available.

-   The Key Broker will require the KMIP server’s client certificate, client key and root ca certificate. This key and certificate will be available in KMIP server.

???+ note 
    The Key Broker has been validated using the pykmip 0.9.1 KMIP server as a 3rd-party Key Management Server. While any general KMIP 2.0-compliant Key Management Server should work, implementation differences among KMIP providers may prevent functionality with specific providers.

### Package Dependencies

N/A

### Supported Operating Systems

supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 and Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS(Bionic Beaver).

### Recommended Hardware

NA

### Installation

11. Provide valid paramenets in the docker run command and execute the docker run command. Update the genertaed RSA Key ID and <keys>.crt in the resources directory.
    docker run -p 8080:2443 -p 80:8080 --mount type=bind,source=/root/<KBS_cert>.crt,target=/root/<KBS_cert>.crt --mount type=bind,source=/root/resources/sgx_default_qcnl.conf,target=/etc/sgx_default_qcnl.conf --mount type=bind,source=/root/resources/nginx.conf,target=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf --mount type=bind,source=/root/resources/keys.txt,target=/root/keys.txt,readonly --mount type=bind,source=/root/resources/pkcs11-apimodule.ini,target=/opt/skc/etc/pkcs11-apimodule.ini,readonly --mount type=bind,source=/root/resources/openssl.cnf,target=/etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf --mount type=bind,source=/root/resources/skc_library.conf,target=/skc_library.conf --add-host=<SHC_HOSTNAME>:<SGX_HOST_IP> --add-host=<KBS_Hostname>:<KBS host IP> --mount type=bind,source=/dev/sgx,target=/dev/sgx --cap-add=SYS_MODULE --privileged=true <SKC_LIBRARY_IMAGE_NAME>
    
    Note: In the above docker run command, source refers to the actual path of the files located on the host and the target always refers to the files which would be mounted inside the container
  
12. Restore index.html for the transferred key inside the container
    Get the container id using "docker ps" command
    docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh 
   
    Download index.html
    wget https://localhost:2443 --no-check-certificate
