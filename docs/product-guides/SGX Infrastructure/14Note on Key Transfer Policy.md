# Note on Key Transfer Policy 

Key transfer policy is used to enforce a set of policies which need to be compiled with before the secret can be securely provisioned onto a sgx enclave

A typical Key Transfer Policy would look as below
```
        "sgx_enclave_issuer_anyof":["83d719e77deaca1470f6baf62a4d774303c899db69020f9c70ee1dfc08c7ce9e"],
        "sgx_enclave_issuer_product_id_anyof":[0],
        "sgx_enclave_measurement_anyof":["ad46749ed41ebaa2327252041ee746d3791a9f2431830fee0883f7993caf316a"],
        "tls_client_certificate_issuer_cn_anyof":["CMSCA", "CMS TLS Client CA"],
        "client_permissions_allof":["nginx","USA"],
        "sgx_enforce_tcb_up_to_date":false
```

**sgx_enclave_issuer_anyof** establishes the signing identity provided by an authority who has signed the sgx enclave. in other words the owner of the enclave

**sgx_enclave_measurement_anyof** represents the cryptographic hash of the enclave log (enclave code, data)

**sgx_enforce_tcb_up_to_date** - If set to true, Key Broker service will provision the key only of the platform generating the quote conforms to the latest Trusted Computing Base

**client_permissions_allof** - Special permission embedded into the skc_library client TLS certificate which can enforce additional restrictons on who can get access to the key,
    In above example: the key is provisioned only to the nginx workload and platform which is tagged with value for ex: USA
