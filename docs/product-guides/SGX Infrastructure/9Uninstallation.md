TLS certificates for each service are issued by the Certificate
Management Service during installation. If the CMS root certificate is
changed, or to regenerate the TLS certificate for a given service, use
the following commands (note: environment variables will need to be set;
typically these are the same variables set in the service installation
.env file):

-   `<servicename> download_ca_cert`
-   Download CMS root CA certificate
    
-   Environment variable CMS\_BASE\_URL=\<url\> for CMS API url
    
-   `<servicename> download_cert TLS` 
-   Generates Key pair and CSR, gets it signed from CMS
    
-   Environment variable CMS\_BASE\_URL=\<url\> for CMS API url
    
-   Environment variable BEARER\_TOKEN=\<token\> for authenticating
        with CMS
    
-   Environment variable KEY\_PATH=\<key\_path\> to override default
        specified in config
    
-   Environment variable CERT\_PATH=\<cert\_path\> to override
        default specified in config
