??? warning classes
    Altering PC clock or memory frequency and/or voltage may (i) reduce system stability and use life of the system, memory and
processor; (ii) cause the processor and other system components to fail; (iii) cause reductions in system performance; (iv) cause additional heat or other damage; and (v) affect system data integrity. Intel assumes no responsibility that the memory, included if used with altered clock frequencies and/or voltages, will be fit for any particular purpose.
Check with memory manufacturer for warranty and additional details.

Tests document performance of components on a particular test, in specific systems. Differences in hardware, software, or configuration
will affect actual performance. Consult other sources of information to evaluate performance as you consider your purchase. For more complete information about performance and benchmark results, visit http://www.intel.com/performance.

Cost reduction scenarios described are intended as examples of how a given Intel- based product, in the specified circumstances and
configurations, may affect future costs and provide cost savings. Circumstances will vary. Intel does not guarantee any costs or cost
reduction.

Results have been estimated or simulated using internal Intel analysis or architecture simulation or modeling, and provided to you for
informational purposes. Any differences in your system hardware, software or configuration may affect your actual performance.

Intel does not control or audit third-party benchmark data or the web sites referenced in this document. You should visit the referenced web site and confirm whether referenced data are accurate.

Intel is a sponsor and member of the Benchmark XPRT Development Community, and was the major developer of the XPRT family of benchmarks. Principled Technologies is the publisher of the XPRT family of benchmarks. You should consult other information and performance tests to assist you in fully evaluating your contemplated purchases.
