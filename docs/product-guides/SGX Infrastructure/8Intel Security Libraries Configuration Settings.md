# Intel Security Libraries Configuration Settings 

???+ note 
    All the answer file options would remain common for containerized K8s deployments with the except of URLS where Kubernetes DNS would be used. The respective `configMap.yml` for each service and agent would carry the defaults for the same when built under `<working directory>/k8s/manifests/<service/agent/db names>`
